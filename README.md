# Health On Door

Full-stack MERN platform for booking verified home nursing and caregiver services.

Health On Door is a startup MVP designed to connect patients with licensed home-care providers and trained caregivers through a simple, responsive web platform.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Many families require basic home healthcare services such as nursing care, injections, elderly assistance, or post-hospital support.  
Currently, these services are:
- Unorganized
- Hard to trust
- Mostly offline
- Difficult to book quickly

## 💡 Solution

Health On Door provides a **digital platform** that:
- Connects patients with **verified home-care providers**
- Allows providers to manage nurses and caretakers
- Enables simple booking, assignment, and service completion
- Acts as a **service aggregator**, not a medical authority

> ⚠️ This platform does **not** provide medical advice or diagnosis.
